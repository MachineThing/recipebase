# Ideas

- twemoji for emojis
- Markdown (via commonmark) formatting
- RSS feed from user profiles (in html or markdown)
- Ability to react to recipes with emojis: 
    - 😍 Seconds please!
    - 😋 Yummy!
    - 🙂 I like it.
    - ️🙁 Could be better.
    - 😭 I'll pass...
- Voting can be disabled however they would be placed down in the search
- Recipes with more than 5 😭 or 10️ 🙁 than all other votes combined will be at the bottom and faded
